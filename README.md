### Rez Bundles

Companion repository to [rez-for-projects](https://github.com/mottosso/rez-for-projects).

**What?**

Rez encourages each package to have an equivalent Git repository, however this repository hosts *multiple* packages.

**Why?**

The packages in this repository are either too small or too related to manage in in separate Git repositories.
